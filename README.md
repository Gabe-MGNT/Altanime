# Altanim (currently not stable)
Web platform about anime, contains differents functions like a dynamic search, a game of higher or lower, or live recommandations content based.

## Context 
I wanted to learn JS/AJAX and how to use API.
So this project was made to learn JS as it goes and to create an API.

## Data
All the data were taken from MAL using scrapy. 

## Roadmap
